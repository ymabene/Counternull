\title{Creates difference of means permutation vector for null distribution}
\usage{
permutation_null_diff_means(rand_matrix, variable, iterations)
}
\arguments{
\item{rand_matrix}{Matrix with unique randomizations for exposure
assignment}

\item{variable}{Variable measured for test statistic
Format: sample_data$column}

\item{iterations}{Number of unique arrangements of exposure assignments
used to generate distribution (At most the number of rows in rand_matrix)}
}
\value{
Vector with all generated test statistics in null distribution
}
\description{
Resamples data to create null distribution. Returns vector with test
statistics in null distribution.
